This directory contains the DSP testsuite

To run the testsuite follow these steps:

1. Make sure that 'cver' and 'ajardsp-asm' are in $PATH

2. From this (tests) directory issue the command:

../tools/do-tests.pl

3. The tests/workdir directory will now contain output produced by the
tests. This includes:

test.verilog.dump - Signal dump from the RTL simulation
test.verilog.log  - stdout/stderr from the RTL simulation
test.imem         - Instruction memory image produced by the assembler
test.res          - Data memory image that was dumped after simulation

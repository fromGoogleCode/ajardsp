[0] - Parallel bit; if set the next instruction executes in parallel
      with this one.

[1]   	- Size bit; size of current instruction
      	- 1'b1 - 32bits
      	- 1'b0 - 16bits

[3:2] 	- Functional Unit
	- 2'b00 - PCU (Program Control Unit)
	- 2'b01 - LSU (Load Store Unit)
	- 2'b10 - CU  (Computational Unit)
	- 2'b11 - BMU (Bit Manipulation Unit)

[29] - True 32bit instruction (a 16bit instruction with predicate bits
       is not a true 32bit even though it occupies 32bits). When set
       the instruction has 32bit encoding.

[31:30] - Predicate bits; only execute insn if predicate bit 0-3 is
          set (bit 0 is always set).

+ There is a predicated 32-bit counterpart of every 16-bit instruction.
+ Some instructions are only available in 32-bit format.
+ Every 32-bit instruction is predicatable.
